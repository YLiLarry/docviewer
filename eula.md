## LICENSE 
To use Pointer Browser software, you must agree to this agreement [LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT](https://www.apple.com/legal/macapps/dev/stdeula/).
By using Pointer Browser software, you agree to this agreement.

## Privacy Statement
By using Pointer Browser software, you agree with the privacy policy stated in this document.
Pointer Browser is a web-browser software. 
While using Pointer Browser, the software may transmit necessary data to the website that you are viewing. 
This may include, as requested by the website, the data you agree to provide to the website such as cookies, 
login information, or other data the website stores and collects during your visit.

When the __Discoveries__ feature is explicitly enabled by you, Pointer Browser keeps a record of primary and secondary links of your visited webpage. 
Here _primary links_ refer to the links on the webpage you are visiting, and _secondary links_ refer to the links on the webpage that a _primary link_ links to,
provided that your settings also explicitly allow the secondary links to be visited.
This record of links is only stored locally on your computer. Pointer Browser does not transmit this data over the network or to any third-party software. 
Otherwise, Pointer Browser does not collect or store any other your personal data.

## Legal
Pointer Browser's _discovery_ feature is implemented with a "shallow crawler" which inspects links at most one depth down a current webpage you visit,
this means it only goes down at most one link-level that you can otherwise go down by clicking a link on a webpage. 
Although this should be differentiated from a common-sense web-crawler that traverses and inspects the entire website.
Depending on your location and what website you visit, web-crawling may be allowed or prohibited by law.
While Pointer Browser respects the robot.txt file of a website, 
it is your responsibility to make sure that when browsing with the discovery feature enabled, 
you are not violating the website's _Terms of Service_ or other equivalence. 
Pointer Browser software is not responsible for any legal damage cause by your misusage of this feature. 

When the _discovery_ feature is disabled, you do not need to worry about this.
